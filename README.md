Rust and React Slime Volley, the one you played at the documentation center as a child.

Here is my roadmap generated with the help of Dust :)

@codingBuddy I want to create a slime volley game in react and rust in my github here : https://github.com/ngaga/slime-volley/tree/main. Where should I start?
@codingBuddy
To start your Slime Volley game using React for the frontend and Rust for the backend, follow this structured approach:
Setup Your Project Structure:
Frontend (React):
Create a new directory frontend in your project.
Initialize a new React app using Create React App inside this directory.
npx create-react-app frontend

Backend (Rust):
Create a new directory backend in your project.
Initialize a new Rust project using Cargo.
cargo new backend

Define Communication Protocol:
Decide on how the frontend will communicate with the backend. WebSockets are a good choice for real-time games.
Develop the Game Logic:
Rust Backend:
Implement game logic such as player movements, ball physics, and scoring.
Use a WebSocket library like tokio-tungstenite for real-time communication.
React Frontend:
Develop the user interface with components for the game arena, score display, and controls.
Use a library like reconnecting-websocket to handle WebSocket communications.
Integrate Frontend with Backend:
Connect the React app to the Rust server using WebSockets to send and receive game data.
Testing and Debugging:
Test the game thoroughly to ensure all components interact correctly and the game logic is sound.
Deployment:
Deploy the Rust backend to a suitable hosting service that supports Rust (like Heroku or AWS).
Build the React app and deploy it to a static hosting service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.
Version Control and CI/CD:
Use Git for version control. Push your code to the main branch on your GitHub repository.
Optionally, set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
